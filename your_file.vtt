00:02.583 --> 00:04.208
In this lesson, we'll take a look

2
00:04.292 --> 00:07.208
at how to connect Google ads to GA4

3
00:07.333 --> 00:08.917
and all the benefits

4
00:08.958 --> 00:09.667
this brings.

5
00:10.583 --> 00:13.250
By connecting ads to GA 4,

6
00:13.333 --> 00:16.417
the data will flow
both ways between the products.

7
00:16.958 --> 00:21.292
This way, you'll be able to see
your Google ads campaigns

8
00:21.417 --> 00:23.000
in the acquisition Overview

9
00:23.083 --> 00:29.833
report, access new Google ads dimensions
in the user acquisition report,

10
00:30.167 --> 00:31.250
import analytics

11
00:31.333 --> 00:34.375
conversions into your Google ads account,

12
00:34.583 --> 00:39.000
and enhance your Google ads remarketing
with

13
00:39.083 --> 00:40.625
analytics audience data.

14
00:41.833 --> 00:45.833
Additionally, you'll be able
to see your Google ads campaigns

15
00:45.958 --> 00:48.042
in the advertising workspace,

16
00:48.292 --> 00:50.583
including the attribution reports.

17
00:51.958 --> 00:53.625
The process of linking Google ads

18
00:53.708 --> 00:57.125
to property it's very similar
to connecting search

19
00:57.208 --> 00:57.625
console.

20
00:58.833 --> 01:05.083
First, go under the admin section
and Scroll down in the properties section

21
01:05.375 --> 01:06.250
where you'll

22
01:06.333 --> 01:08.667
find the Google ads links.

23
01:09.750 --> 01:12.250
Click on it and when
the screen opens.

24
01:13.042 --> 01:14.250
Click on the link button.

25
01:15.500 --> 01:18.958
Next, click on choose
Google add accounts.

26
01:19.833 --> 01:25.375
And here you'll see all the add accounts
connected to your current Google account.

27
01:26.375 --> 01:28.208
If you don't see anything here,

28
01:28.542 --> 01:31.500
please make sure that
you have administrative

29
01:31.583 --> 01:32.000
access

30
01:32.167 --> 01:35.583
to Google ads with your current
Google account.

31
01:36.875 --> 01:38.417
Just to think, you should know,

32
01:38.708 --> 01:41.833
if you link to a Google
ads manager account,

33
01:42.125 --> 01:43.208
any data

34
01:43.292 --> 01:45.625
that you import from analytics

35
01:45.875 --> 01:47.958
will be available available to you.

36
01:49.083 --> 01:52.500
And to you all of your client accounts.

37
01:54.083 --> 01:57.792
Next, select the account
and click confirm.

38
01:59.500 --> 02:03.625
Then click next and at this point

39
02:03.708 --> 02:07.333
you can choose to disable
personalised advertising.

40
02:08.208 --> 02:10.708
Basically if you disable this,

41
02:10.792 --> 02:14.667
then GA4 audience list
and remarketing event parameters

42
02:14.875 --> 02:18.375
will not be shared
with connected Google Ads account.

43
02:19.208 --> 02:21.292
If you disable auto tagging,

44
02:21.667 --> 02:25.917
Google Analytics will not associate
Google ads data with

45
02:26.000 --> 02:30.208
customer clicks and the reports
will have less data to show you.

46
02:31.083 --> 02:33.875
I would suggest you leave both settings on

47
02:34.125 --> 02:36.375
unless you know exactly
what you're doing

48
02:36.458 --> 02:38.625
and know that you don't
need this data.

49
02:40.000 --> 02:42.875
After you click next you will see
the summary

50
02:43.208 --> 02:44.917
and if everything looks OK,

51
02:45.292 --> 02:45.708
just click

52
02:45.792 --> 02:46.292
submit.

53
02:47.583 --> 02:49.833
When you are done linking
both accounts,

54
02:50.083 --> 02:52.667
you'll automatically start seeing
Google ads

55
02:52.708 --> 02:55.042
data in your Google Analytics reports.

56
02:55.792 --> 02:59.542
Note that this may take up
to 24 hours before this data

57
02:59.625 --> 03:00.917
is actually visible.

58
03:01.375 --> 03:07.833
So you can only make around 400
connexion per GA4 property,

59
03:08.292 --> 03:10.208
but that should be enough

60
03:10.292 --> 03:11.333
for most cases.

61
03:12.917 --> 03:17.292
But to be able to take action
on this data in your Google ads,

62
03:17.667 --> 03:18.667
you will need to also

63
03:18.750 --> 03:23.333
import conversions
or add audiences or do both.

64
03:24.167 --> 03:27.958
So let's take a look at this
and how you can do this.

65
03:29.292 --> 03:31.375
Go to your Google ads account

66
03:31.458 --> 03:33.917
and we'll start by importing
the conversions.

67
03:34.833 --> 03:38.708
If you haven't created any conversions
yet in your G A4 account,

68
03:38.958 --> 03:40.167
you should do that first.

69
03:41.250 --> 03:43.375
Then in the tools.

70
03:44.000 --> 03:47.958
And settings menu,
under the measurement section,

71
03:48.292 --> 03:49.917
click on conversions.

72
03:51.458 --> 03:55.292
In the left corner,
click on the new conversion action,

73
03:55.500 --> 03:56.750
then click import.

74
03:57.708 --> 04:00.708
Here you'll select the GA for property

75
04:00.875 --> 04:04.292
and select whether you're importing
from Firebase

76
04:04.375 --> 04:05.625
or Web data streams.

77
04:07.250 --> 04:12.417
After that, select all the conversions
you wish to import and click import.

78
04:13.583 --> 04:15.542
Then click continue.

79
04:16.625 --> 04:17.625
And finally.

80
04:18.333 --> 04:18.750
Done.

81
04:20.792 --> 04:21.875
When you do this,

82
04:21.958 --> 04:25.375
you'll be able to see GA4 conversion
data in Google ads.

83
04:26.292 --> 04:30.625
But give Google ads smart bidding
access to the data

84
04:30.792 --> 04:32.750
that will help its optimise your

85
04:32.833 --> 04:33.333
bids.

86
04:34.500 --> 04:35.750
Just a small warning,

87
04:36.042 --> 04:38.792
if you have your UA conversion actions

88
04:38.875 --> 04:41.042
already imported, then Google

89
04:41.125 --> 04:43.917
will by default set your GA 4 conversions

90
04:44.083 --> 04:45.250
as secondary

91
04:45.583 --> 04:47.458
to prevent counting
the same event

92
04:47.542 --> 04:51.375
twice, and you'll want
to make them primary.

93
04:52.333 --> 04:55.208
Before Universal Analytics goes away.

94
04:56.708 --> 04:59.958
Next thing we'll do is set
up the audience source

95
05:00.042 --> 05:01.917
to use in your remarketing campaigns.

96
05:03.292 --> 05:05.500
You want to click the tools again

97
05:06.333 --> 05:08.167
and settings menu,

98
05:08.708 --> 05:12.000
and under the shared library section,

99
05:12.375 --> 05:14.208
click on the audience manager.

100
05:15.375 --> 05:19.417
Then in the left menu,
click on your data sources.

101
05:20.583 --> 05:23.667
And in the GA4 and firebase cards,

102
05:24.208 --> 05:27.500
click link to Google Analytics
and Firebase button.

103
05:28.417 --> 05:34.000
Next, click Link next to each
property or project

104
05:34.083 --> 05:36.250
that you want to add to your Google

105
05:36.333 --> 05:37.042
ads account.

106
05:38.042 --> 05:39.958
And you are basically done.

107
05:41.333 --> 05:42.458
Once you do this,

108
05:42.542 --> 05:46.917
you will be able
to expand your reach, manage, monitor,

109
05:47.000 --> 05:47.792
and troubleshoot

110
05:47.875 --> 05:49.375
your audience sources,

111
05:49.792 --> 05:51.625
as well as view tag hits,

112
05:51.958 --> 05:53.375
active parameters,

113
05:53.667 --> 05:55.500
and data lists created

114
05:55.583 --> 05:57.250
for each audience source.

115
05:58.708 --> 06:00.208
This is it for this lecture.

116
06:00.950 --> 06:02.360
And I'll see you
in the next one.
